Use the json file “movies.json” provided along with this instruction as a base model for your UI and API. You can add fields or append data on top as per your needs as long as the basic points listed in the TASK is covered. 

## FRONTEND: 

You can use any front end libraries you are comfortable with. Follow standard folder and resource structures so that it is easy and simple to follow through the code. 

Have a README.md file on how to build and run the UI application. 

 

## BACKEND: 

Initially you can use one of the popular fake server to quickly ramp up the UI however you should create your own API with the technology of your choice before the final submission.
